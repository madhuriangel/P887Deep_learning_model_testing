# P887Deep_learning_model_testing

This repository contains the development and testing of deep learning models like Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)<br>
and the hybrid models to predict the SST using the spatio-temporal time series SST daily data.

**Why These Models**
**1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)<br>**
CNNs are effective in capturing spatial dependencies in the data, making them suitable for processing spatial data such as sea surface temperatures mapped over different geographic locations.
**2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)<br>**
LSTMs excel in handling sequential data, making them ideal for modeling the temporal aspect of SST time series data.
**3. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)<br>**
VAEs can learn efficient data representations and generate synthetic data, which can be useful for anomaly detection and understanding variations in SST patterns.
**4. Hybrid Models<br>**
Combining CNNs and LSTMs leverages both spatial and temporal features, providing a comprehensive approach to predicting SST.
